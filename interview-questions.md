# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: this is a keyword used with an object that is being identified when invoked or called.

  Researched answer: The this keyword in JavaScript holds the reference of the object. Also, the this keyword has four orders when finding out which object is being referenced: global scope, object’s method, call() or apply() method and bind() method. An example of using the this keyword is wanting to print a global variable, but using the this keyword within a function.




2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a front-end UI framework developed by a person that works at Facebook. It provides a lot of out-of-the-box tools to get easily up and running. React uses states, props, and components to allow dynamically reactive sites being built. You would want to use React, because it can be very powerful tool to use and easy to get started and learn.

  Researched answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes it easy to efficiently update and render changes within your code. Also, React uses the virtual DOM which represents a real DOM that is manipulated by the browser, which allows the render of a webpage to be lightning fast. React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript. Users would want to use React, because of it’s quickness to render visual user interfaces out of the box.




3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The render() method is required in order for the React class to run.

  Researched answer: The lifecycle method is broken down into 3 steps: mounting, updating, and unmounting. The mounting phase is a part of the constructor, render and methods. The update step will include the setState gets triggered. Lastly, the unmounting occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM. The lifecycle method that is required is the render method in the mounting phase.



4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a JavaScript extension that is used in React. It allows JavaScript syntax to be used very easily in React code by using curly braces. The difference between HTML and JSX is JSX can only return 1 item. If there needs to be multiple items returned in JSX, there needs to be a fragment tag before and after all the JSX code. HTML code can return multiple items.

  Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript that makes it easy to write HTML in React. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is JSX self-closes the tags. An example of HTML is <div></div>, but JSX self closes itself like this: <div />. If HTML code is placed in React like the example above, it will not run. However, using the self-closing tag will run as expected.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is an extension added to a codebase. A feature of yarn is to add Jest, which is a testing framework to ensure the codebase is functioning correctly.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a JavaScript package manager that replaces the npm client or other package managers. The purpose of the package manager is to install a piece of code that serves a purpose. When 'yarn start' is ran, it runs the application in development mode and opens a local server. The local server can be opened in: http://localhost:3000.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: React using conditions on functions/components to encapsulate behavior. Conditional rendering will work only if certain conditions are met.  Conditional rendering can use if statements, AND && operators, and the ternary operator. Conditioanl rendering components is similar to how conditions work in JavaScript.

2. Object-oriented programming: Object-orientated programming focuses on the objects and data, instead of the function and logic. This style of programming works the best in large code-bases, because it allows the developer and team to work collaboratively on the same project. The fundamental concepts of object-orientated programming is inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction.

3. Ruby: Ruby is an object-oriented programming language that is used for front and back end web development. Ruby is an interpreted languaged like Python, unlike like a compiled one like C or C++. Ruby has been used in many different popular sites: GitHub, AirBnB, Twitch, and Hulu to name a few. If web development is used, Rails is a popular framework that pairs with Ruby to generage web pages.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks consist of methods where you can put statements and call those methods. Blocks are used by using the yield statement and the statements can include a parameter that must be met. Blocks are similar to if/else-if statements in JavaScript that only certain conditions can run if they are met.

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes is a collection of key-value pairs. Hashes are similar to arrays with indexes, but hashes use an object instead of a number. An example of using these hashes is a domain name and it's IP address. Hashes can have values of strings, integers/floats, and arrays. Keys in hashes are similiar to arrays that they are unique and you can only have one key.
